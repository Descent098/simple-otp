# Usage

Note you need a python above version 3.6 because of the f-strings I used, you can check the version by runnning ```python --version```. If you have python installed and it is higher than 3.6 move on to the run section of this readme.

## Download

### Windows 
Download & install python3 [Download from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **make sure to check the box that says 'add to path' when installing**.

Once installed you should be able to type ```python`` into your terminal and get something like this:

```bash
Python 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 21:26:53) [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### Mac OS
Download & install python3 [Download from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once installed you should be able to open up a terminal and run ```python3``` with an output like this:

```bash
Python 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 21:26:53) [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### Linux (untested)

#### Debian Based

Some systems already have it installed, you can verify if it's installed by running ```python3``` in your terminal and getting an output like this:
```bash
Python 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 21:26:53) [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

If that did not work for you follow the steps below.

1. Update apt repos ```sudo apt-get update```
2. Install python 3 using ```sudo apt-get update python3```

## Run

To run use ```python otp.py``` or on *nix systems (including macos) run ```python3 otp.py```
